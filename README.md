Second exercise, dealing with MAVEN and ANT

The purpose of this repository is to learn how to deal with build automation, as part of the Mobile Software Development course "Configuration-Management" at University of Applied Science - FH Joanneum Graz.

Therefore, two projects were created, a Maven and an Ant project, in order to understand the difference between building a project automatically and building a project manually.
